_Hi! My Name is Madeline Kittler and I am a PhD Student at the University of Missouri._

I am a political science PhD student at the [Harry S Truman School of Government & Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri. Before moving to Missouri, I recieved my BA in Political Science from the [University of Central Arkansas]((https://uca.edu/)) _(Go Bears!)_. Professionally, my research interests include American state politics, American political institutions, Public Policy, and Agenda Setting.

You can download a copy of my Curriculum Vitae {{< staticref "Madeline_Kittler_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

As a bit of non-academic background, I was born and raised in Arkansas. I have several years of experience working in both state and local politics in Arkansas (Arkansas Office of Child Support Enforcement, Arkansas Building Authority, and ACLU Arkansas). If I am not researching state legislatures, you can usually find me playing Legends of Zelda, playing with my dogs, and crafting.
